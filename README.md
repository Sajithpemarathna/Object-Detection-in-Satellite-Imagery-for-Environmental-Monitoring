# Object-Detection-in-Satellite-Imagery-for-Environmental-Monitoring
Developed a deep learning model using Faster R-CNN to detect and classify environmental objects such as animals, vehicles, and buildings in satellite imagery. Preprocessed real-world datasets using Python and trained the model on COCO and Pascal VOC images.
